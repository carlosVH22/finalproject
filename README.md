# BI Challenge - SQL Focused Analysis

This repository contains my SQL-based solution to a data analytics challenge involving restaurant reservations and visits in Japan. The goal was to extract insights about visitor behavior using cleaned CSV datasets and structured SQL queries.
**You can find the complete Script for the queries in the bi_challenge_sql file

## üóÉÔ∏è Data Preparation

### Step 1: Data Cleaning (in Python)

* Adjusted inconsistent date/time formats in the CSV files using pandas.
* Replaced `#values` and other invalid entries with `NULL` to ensure correct SQL loading and manipulation.

### Step 2: Import to MySQL

Created a schema `bi_challenge` and defined tables:

```sql
USE bi_challenge;

CREATE TABLE restaurants_visitors (
    id VARCHAR(20),
    visit_date DATE,
    visit_datetime DATETIME,
    reserve_datetime DATETIME,
    reserve_visitors INT
);

CREATE TABLE date_info (
    calendar_date DATE,
    day_of_week VARCHAR(20),
    holiday_flg TINYINT
);

CREATE TABLE store_info (
    store_id VARCHAR(255),
    genre_name VARCHAR(255),
    area_name VARCHAR(255),
    latitude DECIMAL(10, 7),
    longitude DECIMAL(10, 7)
);
```

Loaded data using:

```sql
LOAD DATA INFILE '.../restaurants_visitors_limpio.csv' ...;
LOAD DATA INFILE '.../store_info.csv' ...;
```

## ‚úÖ Data Validation

Counted `NULL` values per column:

```sql
SELECT COUNT(*) - COUNT(column_name) AS nulls FROM table_name;
```

Created a cleaned version:

```sql
CREATE TABLE restaurants_visits_filled AS
SELECT
    id,
    DATE(visit_datetime) AS visit_date,
    visit_datetime,
    reserve_datetime,
    reserve_visitors
FROM restaurants_visitors;
```

## üîç SQL Analysis

### 1. Top 5 Restaurants with Highest Avg. Visitors on Holidays

Grouped data by day to avoid per-hour bias:

```sql
WITH TotalByDay AS (
    SELECT id, visit_date, SUM(reserve_visitors) AS total_visitors_day
    FROM restaurants_visits_filled rv
    LEFT JOIN date_info di ON rv.visit_date = di.calendar_date
    WHERE holiday_flg = 1
    GROUP BY id, visit_date
),
Ranking AS (
    SELECT id, ROUND(AVG(total_visitors_day), 0) AS avg_visitors,
           DENSE_RANK() OVER (ORDER BY AVG(total_visitors_day) DESC) AS restaurants_ranking
    FROM TotalByDay
    GROUP BY id
)
SELECT r.id, si.genre_name, r.avg_visitors, r.restaurants_ranking
FROM Ranking r
JOIN store_info si ON r.id = si.store_id
WHERE restaurants_ranking BETWEEN 1 AND 5
ORDER BY restaurants_ranking;
```

---

### 2. Best Day of the Week (All Restaurants)

```sql
WITH RestDay AS (
    SELECT visit_date, day_of_week, SUM(reserve_visitors) AS avg_visitors
    FROM restaurants_visits_filled rv
    LEFT JOIN date_info di ON rv.visit_date = di.calendar_date
    GROUP BY visit_date, day_of_week
)
SELECT day_of_week, ROUND(AVG(avg_visitors), 1) AS avg_visitors
FROM RestDay
GROUP BY day_of_week
ORDER BY avg_visitors DESC;
```

---

### 3. Weekly Growth in Visitor Count (WoW)

```sql
WITH RestDay AS (
    SELECT visit_date, YEAR(visit_date) AS year, WEEK(visit_date) AS week_num,
           SUM(reserve_visitors) AS total_visitors
    FROM restaurants_visits_filled rv
    LEFT JOIN date_info di ON rv.visit_date = di.calendar_date
    GROUP BY visit_date
    HAVING year = 2017
)
SELECT week_num, SUM(total_visitors) AS visitors,
       LAG(SUM(total_visitors), 1) OVER (ORDER BY week_num) AS prev_week,
       ROUND(((SUM(total_visitors) / LAG(SUM(total_visitors), 1) OVER (ORDER BY week_num)) - 1) * 100, 2) AS WoW_change
FROM RestDay
GROUP BY week_num
HAVING week_num >= 19;
```

---

### 4. Visual Trend - Visitors by Day

```sql
WITH TotalByDay AS (
    SELECT visit_date, SUM(reserve_visitors) AS total_visitors_day
    FROM restaurants_visits_filled
    GROUP BY visit_date
)
SELECT *
FROM TotalByDay
ORDER BY visit_date;
```

> ‚ö†Ô∏è **Key Insight:** Since the data was initially at the hour level, grouping by day and restaurant was crucial to derive accurate, actionable insights.

## üìå Summary

* **Data Engineering:** Cleaned, validated, and loaded multi-source time-based data into a MySQL environment.
* **Data Analysis:** Developed advanced SQL queries using CTEs, window functions, date functions, and aggregations.
* **Business Relevance:** Provided insights on top-performing restaurants, ideal visiting days, and growth trends.



# üîÆ Time Series Forecasting ‚Äì SARIMAX Model

After completing the SQL-based exploratory analysis, a time series forecasting model was developed using Python to predict future restaurant reservations based on historical patterns.

---
### üß© Original Series ‚Äì Restaurant Visitors

- The time series shows **missing data intervals**, which limit the ability to extract continuous trends.
- To enable full analysis, **data imputation** was required to fill these gaps.

---

### üîß Visitor Imputation

- A **linear regression** was fitted to the complete series to estimate the general trend.
- For missing days, the number of visitors was **simulated using a normal distribution**:

  - **Œº (mean):** Estimated trend value at time *t*  
  - **œÉ (std dev):** Historical standard deviation of the series

> This approach generates **stochastic imputations** that are coherent with the observed behavior and variability.

---

### üîç Time Series Decomposition ‚Äì Additive Model

The additive decomposition assumes that the observed series can be expressed as:

**Y‚Çú = T‚Çú + S‚Çú + R‚Çú**

Where:
- **T‚Çú (Trend):** Long-term progression of the series
- **S‚Çú (Seasonal):** Repeating patterns over a fixed period (weekly seasonality in this case)
- **R‚Çú (Residual):** Irregular variations not explained by trend or seasonality

#### Components from the Plot:
- **Original series (`reserve_visitors`):** Total number of visitors over time
- **Trend:** Highlights long-term increases or decreases
- **Seasonality:** Captures weekly visitor patterns
- **Residuals:** Random noise or outliers (notable irregularities appeared in late 2016 and early 2017)

---

### üîÆ Forecasting with SARIMAX Model

- Several configurations were tested; the best-performing model was:
  
  **SARIMAX(1, 0, 1) √ó (1, 1, 1, 7)**

- This model effectively captures **cyclical and seasonal structures**, forecasting 180 days ahead.
- **Wide confidence intervals** indicate increasing uncertainty as the forecast horizon extends.
- Toward the end of the observed series, **irregular patterns and potential outliers** emerged, likely tied to unusual events or data entry issues.

---

### ‚úÖ Model Evaluation ‚Äì Backtesting

- A **30-day backtesting window** was used prior to the forecast period.
- The model's predictions were compared to actual values, revealing challenges in anticipating irregular spikes or anomalies.

#### Performance Metrics on Test Set:
- **MAE:** 110.62  
- **RMSE:** 134.09  
- **MAPE:** 1388.71%

> ‚ö†Ô∏è The unusually high MAPE highlights the presence of extreme deviations in actual values, possibly due to outliers or unexpected visitor behavior.
